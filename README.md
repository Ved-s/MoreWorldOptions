# MoreWorldOptions
This mod allows to generate worlds with custom sizes.
Attempting to load/generate a new world if world larger was generated/loaded before will crash the game (in most cases).

Worlds larger than 8400x2400 tiles will not load if the mod has been disabled.

Minimum world size is 4200x900:
  4200 is the minimal world width for Jungle to generate,
  900 is the minimal world height for Temple to generate
