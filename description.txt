This mod allows to generate worlds with custom sizes.
Attempting to load/generate a new world if world larger was generated/loaded before will crash the game (in most cases).

Worlds larger than 8400x2400 tiles will not load if the mod has been disabled.

Minimum world size is 4200x900 
	2000 is the minimal world width for Crimson/Corruption to generate
	900 is the minimal world height for Temple to generate
